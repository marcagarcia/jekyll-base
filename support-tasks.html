<h3>Favorite Thing about providing technical support?</h3>
<hr>
<p>
	Looking back on my past experience with customer relations and support in general, the feeling that loose ends are tied up and the end product is delivered in full, is my favorite thing about providing technical support. There are few things worse than a dropped ball or ignorance. When people are looking for support, they are reaching out for answers, good or bad. They may even be upset and take their rage out on me, but I know that more often than not... it's not personal. What it comes down to is being professional and knowing how to properly chip away at the larger block that is the problem, into smaller managable sizes until the end solution is found. It's that demeanor that you understand and genuinely want to help that can make everything better. I love when someone treats me like a person so I want to do the same. Plus, being ignorant to your own pitfalls in your product or systems will lead to failure. Always look for improvements and ways to close up loose ends.
