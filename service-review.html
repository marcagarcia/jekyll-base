<h3>Initial impressions </h3>
<hr>
<p>
	Before trying out Netlify's services, I was really hesitant. Deployment is one of the more involved and mind crunching processes in the development process, second only to initial set up. The Netlify service make it so easy that I feel like I am missing anoher few hours of development time. The site is up and running! There have been a mega ton of starter solutions making the build start up process much easier. Netlify actually does a great job at highlighting many of those solutions with StaticGen. And Netlify makes the end process easier as well now, leaving me with a good chunk of my time focusing on the actual content and functionality of my site.

	I am a creative at heart, so creating this site using Netlify made me feel like adding all the bells and wistles I could with the amount of time I saved in initialization and deployment. I had to tell myself to hold off and just focus on getting my content set up first. But I think that is a great value to have in a product. Time is the most expensive resources any one has.

<h3>Tools used</h3>
<hr>

<p>
	I started out with the <b>Jekyll</b> site generator. It looks like it is very popular and would probably have the most support. That came in handy, especially since I am not to familiar with Ruby at all but I am not afraid to dig into languages I am not familiar with. 
</p>
<p>
	Staring with the Jekyll documentation, I set everything up in the terminal including the repository on my personal GitHub. The only issues I encountered was getting all of my dev dependencies set up for Jekyll and github since I developed this on a relatively new MacBook (gem versions, SSH keys, etc...). Google has always been my friend, and my past experience setting up new dev environments helped me comb through any errors I recieved.

<h3>Suggestions</h3>
<hr>

<p>
	There was a lot of reading to be done on figuring out what Netlify actually does and how to use it. Perhaps a link to a blog post or video would help with the introduction. Otherwise, this assignment seems reasonable for the type of work a Support engineer would encounter based on some of the information shared with me. Digging and debugging seems to be the name of the game here.
